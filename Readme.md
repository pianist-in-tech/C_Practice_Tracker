The Title of my app is Let's Practice! Tracker.
The primary goal of the Music Practice Tracker project is to provide musicians with a comprehensive tool for tracking their practice sessions and scheduling rehearsals. The project aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Facilitate Practice Management: Enable musicians to log their practice sessions, including details such as date, time, duration, notes. This helps musicians keep track of their practice routines and monitor their improvement over time.
Personalized Practice Suggestions: Utilize the OpenAI API to offer personalized practice suggestions based on musicians' skill levels, goals, and practice history. This assists musicians in identifying areas for improvement and tailoring their practice sessions to focus on specific techniques, repertoire, or musical concepts.
- Performance Analysis and Improvement: Store practice logs in a PostgreSQL database to facilitate performance analysis and identify trends or patterns in musicians' practice habits. This enables musicians to reflect on their practice routines, set realistic goals, and make informed decisions to enhance their musical performance and proficiency.
- Convenience and Accessibility: Offer a user-friendly and intuitive web application interface that musicians can access from any device with an internet connection. This ensures convenience and accessibility for musicians to track their practice sessions and schedule rehearsals wherever they are, whether at home, in the studio, or on the go.
